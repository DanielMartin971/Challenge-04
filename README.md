# Challenge-04 || Coding Quiz

## Description

This is the 4th project given to us during the coding bootcamp. The quiz was expected to have a time limit, a high score and able to reset the high scores. You can view the high scores anytime from the game or in the menu. Everytime a question is answered incorrectly some of the time limit is decreased more. The game also tells you when you answered a question wrong or correct.

Used some old code I had to give me ideas on timers to use and certain loops with Objects. Also credit to my classmate Bailey for giving me the idea of using a array of objects which made things look cleaner and nicer.
